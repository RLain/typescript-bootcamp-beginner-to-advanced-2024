# üë©‚Äçüíª Udemy Course: [Typescript Bootcamp: Beginner To Advanced (2024 Edition)](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-typescript-2-course)

‚ÑπÔ∏èThis course replaces the [previous course](https://github.com/RLain/typescript-complete-developers-guide) I started. I really
enjoy how Vasco teaches having completed two of his Angular University courses at the point of deciding to swap to his Typescript course.

## Why Typescript?

‚Ä¢ When building in Javascript, it is very easy to write mistakes and not realise until runtime.
‚Ä¢ Typescript allows you to catch errors at compilation time (much quicker to pick up and resolve)
‚Ä¢ Using Typescript has type safety advantages _and_ also powerful autocomplete capabilities. See the .ts file for an example.

üó£Ô∏è Note to self: Typescript makes it easier _to develop_. It is purely to help developers build the codebase. It would be 
limiting to develop on Javascript due to the runtime error delays.
