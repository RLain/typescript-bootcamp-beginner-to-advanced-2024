## Arrow functions vs normal functions - understanding the `this` context

üìÅRelated files:
/fundamentals/14-arrow-functions.ts

Here is an example of using normal functions with a callback

```ts
function saveCourse(course, callback: Function) {
    // Simulating a backend call
    setTimeout(function () {
        callback("success")
    }, 1000)
}

saveCourse({title: "Typescript Bootcamp"},
    function () {
        console.log("Save successful")
    })
```

Here is an example of a simpler syntax using an arrow function

```ts
function saveCourse2(course, callback: Function) { //Note we have kept this as a normal function as Vasco prefers it.
    // Simulating a backend call with an annonymous arrow function [1]
    setTimeout(() => {
        callback("success")
    }, 1000)
}

saveCourse2({title: "Typescript Bootcamp"},
    () => console.log("Save2 successful")) //annonymous arrow function [1]
```

The arrow syntax makes it easier to define functions as values. There is a _fundamental_ difference between 
normal and arrow functions. The 'this context'.

It is important to be aware that _each normal function has its own 'this' context_. In the above where we use
_normal_ functions, the saveCourse() has a 'this' context. And the nexted setTimeout() has it's own.

_However_, when we nest a arrow function, inside a normal function, such as in saveCourse2, the arrow function
inherits it's parent functions 'this' context, and does not have its own. We will cover this in more detail when we get to OOP.

```ts
function saveCourse2(course, callback: Function) {
    this.course = course //Normal functions allow this to be used. This will come up later in the course when we discuss OOP

    setTimeout(() => {
        // This function is inhereting the 'this' context from the outside
        callback(this.course.title ?? "unknown course")
    }, 1000)
}

const callBack = (title: string) => console.log("Save successful.", title)
saveCourse2({title: "Typescript Bootcamp"}, callBack)
```

Some general heuristics:
[1] When creating anonymous functions e.g. function(){}/()=> rather use `arrow functions`.

## Default function parameters

üìÅRelated files:
/fundamentals/15-default-functions.ts

Here is an example of defaulting the lessonsCount number to 0:
```ts
function printCourse(title: string, subtitle: string, lessonsCount: number = 0){
    console.log(`Title: ${title}, Subtitle: ${subtitle}, lessonsCount: ${lessonsCount}`)
}

printCourse("Typescript Bootcamp", "Learning fundamentals", 10)

printCourse("Typescript Bootcamp 2", "Learning fundamentals")

/*
‚ùØ node 15-default-functions.js
Title: Typescript Bootcamp, Subtitle: Learning fundamentals, lessonsCount: 10
Title: Typescript Bootcamp 2, Subtitle: Learning fundamentals, lessonsCount: 0
 */
```

We can do this for all the properties:

```ts
function printCourse(title: string = "Unknown", subtitle: string = "Unknown", lessonsCount: number = 0){
    console.log(`Title: ${title}, Subtitle: ${subtitle}, lessonsCount: ${lessonsCount}`)
}

// Don't need to pass in anything
printCourse()

/*
‚ùØ node 15-default-functions.js
Title: Unknown, Subtitle: Unknown, lessonsCount: 0
 */
```

When providing default values, the compiler can infer the type and we can simplify

```ts
function printCourse(title = "Unknown", subtitle = "Unknown", lessonsCount = 0){
    console.log(`Title: ${title}, Subtitle: ${subtitle}, lessonsCount: ${lessonsCount}`)
}
```

## Object spread operator

üìÅRelated files:
/fundamentals/16-spread-operator.ts

```ts
interface Course {
    title: string,
    subtitle: string,
    stats: {
        lessonsCount: number,
    }
}

let course: Course = {
    title: "Typescript Bootcamp",
    subtitle: "Learn the fundamentals",
    stats: {
        lessonsCount: 0,
    }
}

const courseCopy = {
    ...course
}
```

Side note:
"A `shallow` copy duplicates the top-level properties of an object, but nested objects are still referenced. 
A `deep` copy duplicates all levels of an object, creating entirely new instances of nested objects."
[Source](https://www.greatfrontend.com/questions/quiz/explain-the-difference-between-shallow-copy-and-deep-copy)

There is a critical different to a shallow vs deep copy. Any changes to nested references in a shallow copy _will_ 
affect the original. Whereas a deep copy is completely independent and will not affect the original. [Read for more context](https://www.greatfrontend.com/questions/quiz/explain-the-difference-between-shallow-copy-and-deep-copy)

The spread operator allows us to easily create a `shallow` copy. 

```ts
// This is a shallow copy
const courseCopy = {
    ...course
}

console.log(course)
courseCopy.stats.lessonsCount = 5 //Changes here...

console.log(courseCopy)
console.log(course) // ...do change the original!

console.log('___________________')

// This is a deep copy
const courseCopyDeep = {
    ...course,
    stats: {
        ...course.stats,
    }
}

console.log(course2)
courseCopy.stats.lessonsCount = 5 //Changes here...

console.log(courseCopyDeep)
console.log(course2) // ...do not change the original
```

There is no existing method/approach in Typescript to create a deep copy in a quick way (the method I used above
would not be quick if multiple nestings/deeper nestings!)

Vasco recommends using the [npm package clone-deep](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clone-deep).


## Typescript Object Destructuring

üìÅRelated files:
/fundamentals/17-object-destructuring.ts

```ts
function printCourse3(course: Course) {
    const { title, subtitle, lessonsCount } = course //This is destructuring

    console.log(`3- Title: ${title} Subtitle: ${subtitle}, LessonsCount: ${lessonsCount}`)
}

function printCourse4(course: Course) {
    const { title, ...rest } = course //This is using the spread operator (remember rest can be named anything)

    console.log(`4- Title: ${title} Subtitle: ${rest.subtitle}, LessonsCount: ${rest.lessonsCount}`)
}
```

## Typescript Array Spread & Destructuring Operators

üìÅRelated files:
/fundamentals/18-array-spread-destructuring.ts

Here is an example of using the spread operator:
```ts
const numbers = [1, 2, 3]

const moreNumbers = [...numbers, 4, 5, 6]

console.log(moreNumbers) // Returns [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ]
```

This is an example of destructuring:
```ts
// Destructuring
const [ first, second, ...remainder] =  moreNumbers

console.log('Numbers', first, second)
console.log('Remainder', remainder)

// Numbers 1 2
// Remainder [ 3, 4, 5, 6 ]
```

## Typescript Rest Arguments/Parameters

üìÅRelated files:
/fundamentals/19-rest-arguments.ts

Vasco starts this lecture by explaining that we have a function that we want to be able to pass in multiple courses too. 
This naturally led to the following being built (note to future self, I was typing this intuitively before he did which is
interesting from a way-embedded-into-brain realisation):
```ts
function printCourses(message: string, courses: Course[]) {
    console.log(message)

    for(let course of courses) {
        console.log(course.title)
    }
}

printCourses("Welcome to the Angular University", [course1, course2])
```

But there is a nicer way to write this leveraging off Typescript Rest Arguements. This makes the syntax a little bit more readable
and user friendly, and allows us to pass in an undetermined amount of inputs e.g. course1 -> courseN.

```ts
// Simply adding the spread operator converts courses into a rest argument
function printCourses(message: string, ...courses: Course[]) {
    console.log(message)

    for(let course of courses) {
        console.log(course.title)
    }
}

printCourses("Welcome to the Angular University", course1, course2) //Note we no longer pass into an array here.
```

## Debugging Typescript in the browser

üìÅRelated files:
/fundamentals/20-debugging-typescript.ts

Typescript can be run in two different environments:
a) In the browser
b) In a Node backend
Essentially anywhere with a Javascript runtime environment.

First we are going to debug a plain Javascript program. We do this via the index.html file and using the debugger syntax.
We run this page using the lite server using 'npm run start' ("start": "lite-server").

```ts
const courseName = "Typescript Bootcamp"

debugger; //Breakpoint

if(courseName){
    const subtitle = "Learn the language"

    printCourseName(courseName)
}

function printCourseName(courseName: string) {
    debugger; //Breakpoint

    console.log('The course name is ' + courseName.toUpperCase())
}
```

Note that debugger _only_ works when Dev Tools are open on the browser. 

If we want to debug the actual Typescript file using the browser we use the normal tsc command
however add the --sourceMap reference e.g. `$ tsc --sourceMap 20-debugging-typescript.ts`

Once compiled, this creates both the normal plain Javascript file _and_ a .js.map file. We can now run our server
and when Dev Tools is opened on the browser, we can see both the .js and .ts file under Sources. With the added breakpoints
we can see the code stepping through on the .ts file.

## Debugging Typescript in a Node environment

üìÅRelated files:
/fundamentals/20-debugging-typescript.ts

To debug a Typescript file in a Node envirnoment, again we first use the tsc --sourceMap command. Then when running node, we must 
add the --inspect flag e.g. `$ node --inspect 20-debugging-typescript.js`. This then immediately spins up and executes the program.

To see the debugger in action, we need to use the --inspect-brk flag `$ node --inspect-brk 20-debugging-typescript.js`. This starts the program then stops
and allows us to attach a debugger. We can then step through the code, the same as on the browser.

TLDR:
- Use --inspect when you don't need to pause on startup, but want the option to debug or profile later during execution.
- Use --inspect-brk when you want to debug startup code, inspect environment setup, or step through from the very first line.

## Typescript Shorthand Object Creation Notation

This is the name used for when you can just define the key.

üìÅRelated files:
/fundamentals/21-shorthand-object-creation-notation.ts

```ts
interface Course {
    title: string;
    subtitle: string;
    lessonsCount: number;
}

const courseTitle = "Typescript Bootcamp",
    courseSubtitle = "Learn the language",
    lessonsCount = 20

const course: Course = {
    title: courseTitle,
    subtitle: courseSubtitle,
    lessonsCount //This is an example of shorthand notation. We don't need a key:value pair definition and can simply state the key.
}

// We can simplify further ...
const title = "Typescript Bootcamp",
    subtitle = "Learn the language"

const course2: Course = {
    title, //This is an example of shorthand notation.
    subtitle, //This is an example of shorthand notation.
    lessonsCount //This is an example of shorthand notation.
}
```
