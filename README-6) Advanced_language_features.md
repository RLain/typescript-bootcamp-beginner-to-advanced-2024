## Typescript Tuples and how to use them

üìÅRelated files:
/fundamentals/23-tuples.ts

This is a less known feature of Typescript that you may come across if doing RxJS (Angular framework).

- A tuple is a record in a database (outside of Typescript)
- A tuple looks like an array.

Everything you can do with a tuple, you can do with a custom object type (via Interface)
so this is not the most critical feature of Typescript.

See the differences here (Vasco recommends using an Object in real life over a tuple for this use case)

```ts
// Object
interface Course {
    title: string
    subtitle: string
    lessonsCount: number
}

function createCourseObject(title: string, subtitle: string) {
    const course = {
        title,
        subtitle
    } as Course

    return course
}

// Vs Tuple
type CourseRecord = [string, string, number] // Explicit typing for the tuple

const courseRecord: CourseRecord = ['Typescript', 'Learn the basics', 100] //This is a tuple

function createCourseTuple(title: string, subtitle: string): CourseRecord {
    return [title, subtitle, 100]
}
```

The use of a Tuple should be reserved when the output of the function needs to be a couple of values
that are completely unrelated to each other, and you don't want to define a custom object type just for the
return type of that function. A tuple may be more appropriate here.

Vasco says he rarely uses tuples in his own programs, except when using libraries such as RxJS.
He recommends rather defining custom object types.

## Understanding the Unknown type

üìÅRelated files:
/fundamentals/24-unknown-type.ts

The `any` type is like an escape hatch for the type system and allows any value to be passed in, but
removes the benefits of the typing language.

This is different from `unknown`. 

- `any` and `unknown` are "catch-all" types
- `any` is far more permissive and will compile when typed against all types
-  You can assign any value to a variable of type `unknown` e.g.
```ts
let unknownValue: unknown

unknownValue = true
unknownValue = 10
unknownValue = 'Hello World'
unknownValue = []
unknownValue = {}
unknownValue = null
unknownValue = undefined
```

- However, you cannot assign a variable of type `unknown` to a more specific type without narrowing it first.

```ts
// Any type_____________

let anyValue: any

// All the following are accepted and will compile
let value1: unknown = anyValue
let value2: any = anyValue
let value3: boolean = anyValue
let value4: number = anyValue
let value5: string = anyValue
let value6: Array<any> = anyValue
let value7: object = anyValue
let value8: null = anyValue
let value9: undefined = anyValue

// Unknown type_____________

let unknownValue: unknown

// The following are accepted and will compile...
let value10: unknown = unknownValue
let value11: any = unknownValue
// ...however the rest will return a compilation error
let value12: boolean = unknownValue
let value13: number = unknownValue
let value14: string = unknownValue
let value15: Array<any> = unknownValue
let value16: object = unknownValue
let value17: null = unknownValue
let value18: undefined = unknownValue
```

Here is an example of narrowing the type - see the next lecture for further details.

```ts
function handleValue(value: unknown) {
  if (typeof value === 'string') {
    console.log(value.toUpperCase()) // safe, value is now known to be string
  }

  if (typeof value === 'number') {
    console.log(value.toFixed(2)) // safe, value is a number
  }
}
```

‚úÖ TL;DR
- As a general rule try to avoid using both `any` and `unknown`.
- Use unknown when you want type safety but don‚Äôt yet know the type.
- Use any only when you want to intentionally bypass the type system.
- You must narrow unknown with type guards before using it.

## Understanding Type narrowing and Type predicates

üìÅRelated files:
/fundamentals/25-type-predicates.ts

" Predicates in programming are simply functions that return a boolean to answer a yes/no question. 
Several JavaScript built-in array methods, such as filter, find, every, and some, use predicates 
to help with decision-making." [Source](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-are-type-predicates-in-typescript/)


```ts
// Example, we want to do a type check before assigned to Course
// The usage of `x is y` makes this a type predicate function
// This allows the typescript compiler to convert the type from unknown to the know interface
function isCourse(value: unknown): value is Course {
    const course = value as Course
    return course?.title !== null && course?.subtitle !== null
}

if(isCourse(course)) {
    course.title // title: string
}

// See what happens if we simply use a boolean outcome opposed to a proper type predicate
function isCourseBoolean(value: unknown): boolean {
    const course = value as Course
    return course?.title !== null && course?.subtitle !== null
}

if(isCourseBoolean(course)) {
    course.title // TS2339: Property title does not exist on type unknown
}
```
